**CONTEXT:**
According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

**AIM:**
This project is aimed at predicting whether a patient will have stroke or not using 3 different machine learning algorithms, and determining which of the algorithms is most accurate for the prediction. This prediction will help the patients in taking measures that will enable them to avert the future risk of getting stroke, esepecially as it entails working in regards to the interractions between causal factors, predisposing factors and unhealthy lifestyles that can lead to stroke.

**SOURCE OF THE DATASET USED:**
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggel, and contains medicals records and important features needed to make predictions which will aid in making the right predictions.

**FEATURES(DATA DICTIONARY):**
1) id: unique identifier

2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"

3) age: age of the patient

4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease

6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"

7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"

8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"

9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood

10) bmi: body mass index

11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*

12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient
